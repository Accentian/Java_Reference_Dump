Understanding the code

    Lines 4-5: The two int type variables length and height are created. Both variables are private to ensure they can only be accessed by member methods.

    Lines 7-9: The overloaded constructor is created. It takes as parameters, two int type variables. The first argument is assigned to the length and the second to the height. The constructor is public so that objects of type rightAngleTriangle can be made from any other class.

    Lines 12-14: This is the method for calculating the area of the triangle. Note that the method does not take in any parameters as it calculates the area using the private members. It calculates the area of the right angle triangle by the formula 0.5* (length * height).The return type for the method is double as it returns the area calculated.

    Lines 18-20: This creates a static method which simply takes in as a parameter, the rightAngleTriangle object and returns the answer of the area method.
        The method was made static so it will belong to the whole class it is created in and not for every object of that class.
