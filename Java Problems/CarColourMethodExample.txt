/**
Line 3: A String colour is created which will store the car colour.

Lines 5-10: Helper methods are created within the class to set and get the car colour.

Lines 11-16:

    A main method creates a new car object and the initial colour of the car is set as Pink.

    The method that returns the car colour is called.

    Then the car colour is set to Blue using an external method which is explained below (line 18-20).

    The car colour is then printed again, to see if the changes within the above-mentioned method are applicable to the actual object.

Lines 18-20

    A new method is declared that takes in the car object as an argument.
    Then uses the colour String belonging to the car class and modifies its value to Blue.
    Note that the function does not return anything.
